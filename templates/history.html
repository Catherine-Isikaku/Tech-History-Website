    <h1>Where Do We Start?</h1>
    <p>
      The history of computer science is a journey from ancient counting tools to today’s digital age. It began with early mechanical calculators and mathematical theories, advanced through theoretical breakthroughs by pioneers like Ada Lovelace and Alan Turing, and accelerated with the invention of electronic computers. The mid-20th century saw the rise of personal computers and the internet, forever transforming the way society communicates, works, and innovates.

    <h2>Key Milestones in Computer Science History</h2>
      <h3>Pre-1900s: Foundations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Abacus (2700 BCE): One of the first tools for performing calculations.</li>
        <li>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz: Developed binary number system and early calculator (Stepped Reckoner).</li>
        <li>Charles Babbage: Designed the Analytical Engine, the first mechanical computer (1830s).</li>
        <li>Ada Lovelace: Wrote the first algorithm—recognized as the first computer programmer.</li>
